Hi! 

This repo is really just an example of how to animate the LCD screens on the Ergodox-Infinity.

You will need QMK's firmware to actually build this, but this repo is built in such a way that you can copy all of the directories here and merge them into qmk's repo. The files will then be in their proper places in order to build the ergodox_infinity keyboard with the mattrcole layout.

Only files that were either created or modified in order to add animations are found in this repo (except for this readme and the licenses). Hopefully that should make modifying these for your own purposes easier.
